# Quickstart Guide: Personal TODO Management Web Application

## Validation Workflow

This quickstart serves as both user guide and integration test specification. Each step validates functional requirements from the specification.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and pnpm installed
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Terminal/command line access

### Installation Steps
```bash
# 1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
pnpm create next-app@latest todo-app --typescript --tailwind --app

# 2. Navigate to project directory  
cd todo-app

# 3. Install testing dependencies
pnpm add -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom happy-dom

# 4. Install UUID for unique ID generation
pnpm add uuid
pnpm add -D @types/uuid

# 5. Configure Vitest in package.json
# Add to scripts: "test": "vitest", "test:ui": "vitest --ui"

# 6. Start development server
pnpm dev
```

   - ✅ Filter counts: "All (0), Active (0), Completed (0)"

### Scenario 6: Data Persistence (FR-007: Persistent storage)
**Expected Result**: TODO data survives browser refresh

1. **Action**: Add todo "Test persistence"
2. **Action**: Mark it as completed
3. **Action**: Refresh browser (F5 or Cmd+R)
4. **Validate**:
   - ✅ Todo "Test persistence" still exists
   - ✅ Completion status preserved (still marked completed)
   - ✅ Filter counts accurate after reload

### Scenario 7: Filter Interactions (FR-005: Status filtering)
**Expected Result**: All filter states work correctly with mixed data

1. **Setup**: Add 3 todos, complete 2 of them
2. **Action**: Test each filter option
3. **Validate**:
